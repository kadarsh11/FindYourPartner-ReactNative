<Text style={{fontWeight:'bold',fontSize:19,marginTop:20}}>12. LICENSE LIMITATIONS </Text>
<Text>
The Service is a carefully controlled environment designed to provide the maximum level of enjoyment for all players. In order to preserve an enjoyable experience for all users, and to protect the intellectual property rights of Find Your Partner, the activities identified in this Section 2 ("License Limitations") are strictly prohibited and violate the conditions or limitations on your license to use the Service. Therefore, any use of the Service in violation of such restrictions exceeds the scope of the License granted to you and constitutes infringement of your license, and is grounds for immediate revocation of your license with or without any prior notice from Find Your Partner to you. Use of the Service in excess of these provisions, or use at all after your license is revoked, infringes Find Your Partner's or its licensor's copyrights and other intellectual property rights subsisting in and relating to the Service.

Violating these License Limitations may result in the suspension or permanent banning of your account, or such other lesser measures described in Section 3 which Find Your Partner may take in its sole discretion, or an action for copyright infringement or other legal claims, all of which are reserved. You agree that offering or providing banned services as described in this Section 2 and Section 3 to other players of the Service constitutes improper interference with Find Your Partner's contracts with such players, and Find Your Partner reserves the right to take formal legal action against you if you do so, without warning.

The Prohibited Activities are as follows:



3.1 Sharing Account Information. You may not share your account or login information with anyone except as permitted by the Facebook terms of use.

<Text style={{fontWeight:'bold',fontSize:19,marginTop:20}}>4. OWNERSHIP</Text>
<Text>
Find Your Partner (and, to the extent applicable, its licensors) owns and shall retain all right, title and interest in and to the Service, and will be the sole owner of any and all data you generate through your use of the Service, including but not limited to accounts, character attributes, statistics and assets.

YOU MAY NOT SELL, RENT, OR REPRODUCE ANY CHARACTER OR ANY VIRTUAL ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH CHARACTER OR WITH ANY ACCOUNT CONTROLLED BY YOU FOR ANY COMMERCIAL PURPOSE. IF YOU DO SO, THIS LICENSE IS IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED.


</Text>
<Text style={{fontWeight:'bold',fontSize:19,marginTop:20}}>5. REDEEMABLE POINT SYSTEM</Text>
<Text>
5.1 Introduction to Redeemable Points. The Service may include a redeemable point system featuring redeemable points ("Redeemable Points") that may be used to obtain certain virtual products and services offered by Find Your Partner. Redeemable Points may be called different names in different games, but this Agreement will apply to all Redeemable Points offered by Find Your Partner.



5.2 Redeemable Points are Merely Licensed Virtual Goods and Have No Monetary Value. Redeemable Points are virtual goods licensed directly to you and owned at all times by Find Your Partner. Redeemable Points have no monetary value, and you do not have any personal property rights in Redeemable Points. Therefore, you may not trade Redeemable Points for cash, currency or any form of property, license or rights except for the virtual products and services that Find Your Partner chooses to offer in its sole discretion. You may not transfer Redeemable Points to any other person or entity or receive Redeemable Points from any other person or entity for any reason.



5.3 Limits on Redeemable Points. In order to protect your security and to deter fraud, Find Your Partner may impose limits on the amount of Redeemable Points that you may license per transaction and per month. Find Your Partner may also limit the maximum amount of Redeemable Points that you may hold in your account at any one time.



5.4 Usage of Redeemable Points. You may redeem Redeemable Points for certain virtual products and/or online services offered directly to the public by Find Your Partner. Find Your Partner reserves the right to adjust the amount of Redeemable Points due for each product and online service at any time, in its sole discretion, without notice. Once redeemed, Redeemable Points will be deducted from your account balance and cannot be used again. You have no right to reverse a transaction once it is completed. However, if Find Your Partner determines that an incorrect price (in Redeemable Points) is identified for a product or online service, it reserves the right to reverse and/or nullify any such transaction.



5.5 No Cash Refunds. Except as required by law, you have no right to receive a cash refund for unused Redeemable Points.



5.6 Expiration of Redeemable Points and Termination of a Redeemable Point System. In the United States, Redeemable Points do not expire, but Find Your Partner reserves the right to alter or terminate a Redeemable Point system at any time and without notice, in its sole discretion. In other words, you may redeem Redeemable Points for as long as Find Your Partner chooses to make the Redeemable Point system available, which Find Your Partner has no obligation to do. Accordingly, we encourage you to redeem your Redeemable Points sooner rather than later. In the countries other than the United States, Redeemable Points shall expire twenty–four (24) months after they were issued.



5.7 Management of Redeemable Points. You agree that Find Your Partner has the absolute right to manage, modify, regulate and control any Redeemable Point system in its sole discretion. If Find Your Partner suspects any fraudulent, abusive or unlawful activity with respect to Redeemable Points, or any violation of this Agreement, then Find Your Partner may reduce or liquidate your Redeemable Points, or deactivate, suspend or terminate your access to the Service. Find Your Partner will not be liable to you or any third party for exercising these rights.



5.8 Redeemable Points and Virtual Goods Waiver. BY ACCEPTING THIS AGREEMENT OR USING THE SERVICE, YOU AGREE NOT TO ASSERT OR BRING ANY CLAIM OR SUIT AGAINST Find Your Partner, ITS AFFILIATES, ITS BACK-END SERVICE PROVIDERS, OR THEIR EMPLOYEES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO REDEEMABLE POINTS OR VIRTUAL GOODS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY CLAIM WHICH IS BASED ON A THEORY THAT YOU "OWN" REDEEMABLE POINTS OR ANY VIRTUAL GOODS IN ANY GAME OR SERVICE OFFERED BY Find Your Partner OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR THAT YOU LOST THE "VALUE" OF VIRTUAL GOODS OR REDEEMABLE POINTS AS A RESULT OF DELETION OR ACCOUNT TERMINATION BY Find Your Partner, OR FOR ANY MODIFICATIONS IN THE AMOUNT OF REDEEMABLE POINTS REQUIRED TO ACCESS CERTAIN GOODS OR SERVICES, OR THE REMOVAL OF ACCESS TO ANY GOODS/SERVICES, OR FOR ANY MALFUNCTIONS AND/OR "BUGS" IN Find Your Partner'S GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING A REDEEMABLE POINT SYSTEM.
